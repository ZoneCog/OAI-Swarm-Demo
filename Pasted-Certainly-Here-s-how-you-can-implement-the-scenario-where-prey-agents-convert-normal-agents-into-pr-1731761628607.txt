Certainly! Here's how you can implement the scenario where prey agents convert normal agents into prey to form alliances, and when their numbers are sufficient, they organize into a "bigger fish" formation to chase the predators.

**Explanation of the Code:**

1. **Initializing Agent States:**

   - Each agent is given a `state` attribute if they don't already have one.
   - Prey agents start with `state = 'prey'`.
   - Normal agents start with `state = 'normal'`.

2. **Counting Prey Agents and Determining the Organize Threshold:**

   - The total number of prey agents is counted.
   - An `organize_threshold` is set (e.g., when prey agents are more than 50% of the total agents).

3. **Organizing Prey Agents:**

   - If the number of prey agents meets or exceeds the threshold, their `state` is set to `'organized'`.
   - Otherwise, they remain in the `'prey'` state.

4. **Prey Converting Normal Agents:**

   - Prey agents in the `'prey'` state check for nearby normal agents within a certain distance (e.g., 50 units).
   - If a normal agent is within range, it is converted to a prey agent by setting `role = 'prey'` and `state = 'prey'`.

5. **Updating Positions of Organized Prey Agents:**

   - If there are organized prey agents, they form a "bigger fish" formation and chase the predators.
   - **Formation Center:**
     - A `formation_center` is used as the center point for the formation.
     - It moves towards the average position of the predators.
   - **Moving the Formation Center:**
     - The center moves towards the predators at a certain speed.
   - **Arranging Agents in a Circular Formation:**
     - Organized prey agents are arranged in a circle around the formation center.
     - The circle's radius adjusts based on the number of agents.
     - Each agent calculates its desired position on the circle and moves towards it.

6. **Updating Positions of Other Agents:**

   - **Predators:**
     - Move randomly, possibly representing them being chased.
   - **Prey Agents in `'prey'` State:**
     - Move randomly, possibly avoiding predators.
   - **Normal Agents:**
     - Move randomly until they are converted.

**Visual Representation:**

- **Prey Converting Normals:**
  - Prey agents wander and convert nearby normal agents, increasing their numbers.
- **Organizing into a "Bigger Fish":**
  - When prey agents are plentiful, they form a collective shape resembling a bigger fish.
- **Chasing Predators:**
  - The organized formation moves towards the predators, symbolizing a reversal where the prey becomes the hunter.

**Adjustable Parameters:**

- **Conversion Distance (`50` units):**
  - Determines how close a prey agent must be to convert a normal agent.
- **Organize Threshold (`50%` of total agents):**
  - Sets when prey agents decide to organize.
- **Formation Radius (`50 + num_agents`):**
  - Controls the size of the formation based on the number of organized prey agents.
- **Speeds:**
  - Adjust the multipliers on `speed` to make predators or prey move faster or slower.

**Notes:**

- **Persistent Formation Center:**
  - The `formation_center` is stored as an attribute of the `update_agents` function to persist between calls.
- **Avoiding Overlaps:**
  - The circular arrangement helps distribute agents evenly in the formation.
- **Smooth Movement:**
  - Agents adjust their `angle` to smoothly move towards their desired positions.

**Feel Free to Customize:**

- **Formation Shape:**
  - Modify the arrangement logic to create different shapes (e.g., a line, a spiral, or even the ASCII fish you provided).
- **Behavior Dynamics:**
  - Adjust thresholds and distances to fine-tune how quickly agents convert others and organize.
- **Additional States:**
  - Implement more complex states or behaviors as needed.

**Enjoy testing this behavior in your simulation!** It should create an interesting dynamic where prey agents take control, organize, and turn the tables on the predators, adding depth and excitement to your swarm simulation.
